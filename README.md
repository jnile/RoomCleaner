# RoomCleaner
This project is me creating a PDDL problem visualisation without using an actual PDDL problem layout.

## The Problem
There is a rectangular world with x width and y height. The world can have obstacles/wall and must only have one bot/cleaner. The bot has to visit every tile.

## Approach
Having learnt about PDDL and how a lot of complex problems can be translated into a PDDL problem, I wanted to first grasp my own understanding of how great of a concent this is.
Hence I chose to create a visualisation of a PDDL problem. I chose this problem only because it was the first problem in my head since I wanted to be able to learn the concept for any problem, it did not matter what problem I faced first.
In order to also get a better understanding, instead of converting the problem straight into a PDDL problem and then design the code from PDDL code to a visualisation, I chose to first create the world and then break down problem to be similar to a PDDL problem.
This is because I wanted to understand the difficulties and limitations of this approach before I went , in my opinion the simpler and possibly easier path, from a PDDL problem to the visualisation. I will do the version from a PDDL code to visualtion in the future.
